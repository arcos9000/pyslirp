# Contributing to PyLiRP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PyLiRP! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üéØ Project Goals

PyLiRP aims to provide a robust, secure, and high-performance userspace implementation of SLiRP that:
- Operates entirely without root privileges
- Maintains RFC compliance (PPP, TCP/IP)
- Provides production-ready reliability and monitoring
- Supports both Windows and Linux platforms

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pyslirp.git
   cd pyslirp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Windows additionally:
   pip install -r requirements_windows.txt
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   python test_framework.py
   ```

### Code Structure

- `main.py` - Application entry point and integration
- `pySLiRP.py` - Core PPP/TCP implementation
- `config_manager.py` - Configuration management
- `security.py` - Security and access control
- `monitoring.py` - Metrics and observability
- `error_recovery.py` - Error handling and resilience
- `windows_support.py` - Windows platform integration

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code style
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Include comprehensive docstrings for public methods
- Maintain 4-space indentation
- Keep line length under 100 characters

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings for all new public methods
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Update CLAUDE.md for architectural changes

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Include integration tests for end-to-end features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
Add TCP window scaling support

- Implement RFC 1323 window scaling negotiation
- Add configuration option for window scale factor
- Include tests for various window sizes
- Update documentation with new config parameter
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_framework.py

# Run specific test category
python -c "
import asyncio
from test_framework import *

async def run_tests():
    framework = TestFramework()
    suite = SecurityTestSuite(framework)
    await framework.run_test('Security Tests', suite.test_rate_limiting)

asyncio.run(run_tests())
"
```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end functionality
3. **Performance Tests** - Load and throughput testing
4. **Compliance Tests** - RFC protocol compliance
5. **Security Tests** - Attack simulation and mitigation

### Adding New Tests

When adding new functionality:

1. Create unit tests for the component
2. Add integration tests if it affects the data flow
3. Include performance tests for performance-critical code
4. Add security tests for security-related features

## üîí Security Considerations

### Security-First Development

- Never disable security features by default
- Validate all input from external sources (serial, network)
- Use principle of least privilege
- Log security-relevant events
- Consider denial-of-service implications

### Security Review Process

Security-related changes require:

1. Detailed security analysis in PR description
2. Consideration of attack vectors
3. Performance impact assessment
4. Documentation of security implications

## üêõ Bug Reports
