## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 Release Highlights

This initial release provides a complete, production-ready Python implementation of SLiRP that operates entirely in userspace. Key achievements:

**Complete Userspace Operation**: No root privileges required, no kernel modifications, all networking operations isolated in Python memory.

**Cross-Platform Support**: Full Windows and Linux support with platform-specific optimizations and installation methods.

**Production Ready**: Comprehensive error recovery, monitoring, security, and configuration management suitable for production deployments.

**Windows Focus**: Special attention to Windows userspace deployment with Task Scheduler integration, COM port management, and no-admin-required installation.

**Security First**: Built-in security features including rate limiting, access control, and attack mitigation suitable for network-exposed deployments.

**Monitoring & Observability**: Complete monitoring framework with metrics, health checks, and debugging capabilities for operational excellence.

This release represents a complete rewrite and enhancement of the original SLiRP concept, bringing modern Python capabilities to userspace networking.
